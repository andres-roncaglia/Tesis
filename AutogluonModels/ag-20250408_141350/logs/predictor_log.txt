Inferred time series frequency: 'MS'
Provided train_data has 88 rows, 1 time series. Median time series length is 88 (min=88, max=88). 

Provided data contains following columns:
	target: 'target'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'WQL'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
